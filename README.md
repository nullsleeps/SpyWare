Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what my code does, step by step:
1. `Malware Structure Definition`
The script starts by defining the sections of the code that represent the "malware":
```python
# MalBeginning
# ...
# MalEnd
```
The code that lies between these markers is the part that will replicate itself into other Python files.

2. `Reading Itself`
The code reads its own file to identify and extract the "malware" portion:
```python
with open(sys.argv[0], 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
```
